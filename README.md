## Contributing

This is the general workflow to make a contribution to this repository:

1. [Clone the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
    - If you've already cloned the repository, it helps to do pull the most recent changes (e.g. `git checkout main && git pull`) to reduce conflicts when you merge your feature.
2. Make a feature branch
    - Every feature you develop will be coordinated in a ["feature branch"](https://blog.mergify.com/feature-branch-a-quick-walk-through-git-workflow/), so that features may be developed independently.
    - We will name all features "`feature/your-feature-name`" (all lowercase, [kebab-case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case#Kebab_case)) to distinguish features from hotfixes (e.g. `hotfix/oops-i-made-a-mistake`) and other types of branches.
    - We will merge feature branches directly into `main`.
3. Submit a [pull request (PR)](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests)
    - After you add changes to a topic branch or fork, you can open a pull request to ask your collaborators or the repository administrator to review your changes before merging them into the project.
4. [Request a review for your PR](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/requesting-a-pull-request-review)
    - Requesting a review from other contributors ensures that everyone is on the same page, and that others have the opportunity to point out improvements or changes you might consider.
5. (optional) [Address any merge conflicts](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/addressing-merge-conflicts/resolving-a-merge-conflict-on-github)
6. Merge your PR
